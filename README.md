I am a Software Engineer :computer: from India. Currently working [@Kemuri Technology](https://kemuri.in/) as a Tech Lead. I have worked on various languages but these days I am working on PHP and VueJS mainly. I am also pursuing my Master's Degree [@BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) with specialization in Security :books:.

Except programming and tech, I like to research about various financial instruments as it is my goal to become financially independent one day :moneybag:. You can follow my journey on [Medium](https://aayusharyan.medium.com/).
